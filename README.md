## Roadmap

This is my life roadmap, in this particular order. Note that no one can fully master a field, ever, and I'm not claiming I did. Once I think the knowledge from specific field is enough, I mark it as done, however I still plan to refresh knowledge every few months or so. If you find any of these fields interesting, I encourage you to try and learn them! ðŸ™‚
